Scene: Sci-Fi Alien Invasion 
To showcase this, I had an alien stand in front of the girl's house. The alien had just floated down from the spaceship, which is why there is a huge spaceship right above it. The girl who is being invaded lives on a small planet all alone, and her house is very futuristic and modern. Her house is made up of a house structure, windows, and doors. In her room, I included a bed, some lights, a couch, some couch cushions, shelves, and plants. I used neon colors to give off a more sci-fi futuristic vibe. For inspiration, I was scrolling through the asset store and saw a sci-fi pack and immediately thought of how I could make a scene with that. The main character in this scene is the alien who came to invade the planet. I used the alien for the first and third-person view, and this allowed me to effectively showcase the main parts of the scene. I also included some assets such as trees, buildings, and roads as the background to make the scene more dynamic.
